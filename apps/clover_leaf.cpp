/** @brief CloverLeaf top level program: Invokes the main cycle
  * @author Wayne Gaudin
  * @details CloverLeaf in a proxy-app that solves the compressible Euler
  *  Equations using an explicit finite volume method on a Cartesian grid.
  *  The grid is staggered with internal energy, density and pressure at cell
  *  centres and velocities on cell vertices.

  *  A second order predictor-corrector method is used to advance the solution
  *  in time during the Lagrangian phase. A second order advective remap is then
  *  carried out to return the mesh to an orthogonal state.
  *
  *  NOTE: that the proxy-app uses uniformly spaced mesh. The actual method will
  *  work on a mesh with varying spacing to keep it relevant to it's parent code.
  *  For this reason, optimisations should only be carried out on the software
  *  that do not change the underlying numerical method. For example, the
  *  volume, though constant for all cells, should remain array and not be
  *  converted to a scalar.
  *
  *  This version is based on C/C++ and uses the OPS prototype highlevel domain
  *  specific API for developing Structured mesh applications
