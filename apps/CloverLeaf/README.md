A hydrodynamics mini-app to solve the compressible Euler equations in 2D,
using an explicit, second-order method. See http://warwick-pcav.github.io/CloverLeaf/
for the original version and more details.

This version utilizes the OPS library and preprocessor. With OPS a single
application code is transformed to enable it to be run with a number of
parallelisations: OpenMP, CUDA and MPI and their combinations.


####Directory Structure

* ./ - Developer version that uses only a header file to get the application
running as a sequential application and with unoptimized MPI. Used for application
debugging before using the code generation tools of OPS.

* MPI - MPI and sequential version, code generated through the OPS translator. This
include platform specific optimisations such as verctorization

* MPI_OpenMP - MPI+OpenMP version, code generated through the OPS translator.

* MPI_CUDA - MPI+CUDA version, code generated through the OPS translator. (currently
there is no MPI support for this version)

####Building Cloverleaf

1. set the following environmental variables (e.g. for compiling with Intel compilers)

   export OPS_COMPILER=intel

   export OPS_INSTALL_PATH=~/OPS/ops

   export CUDA_INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.5

   export MPI_INSTALL_PATH=/opt/openmpi-intel/

2. Build the OPS backend libraries:

   cd ~/OPS/ops/

   make

   For systems that does not have CUDA installed comment out the builing of the GPU backend library.
   i.e. change the folloing line

   all: clean core seq openmp mpi cuda

   to

   all: clean core seq openmp mpi #cuda


3. Build the Cloverleaf applications. The following will build the developer version, MPI, MPI+OpenMP and CUDA

   cd ~/OPS/apps/Cloverleaf/

   make
