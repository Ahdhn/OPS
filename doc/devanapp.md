# Developing an OPS Application
This page provides a tutorial in the basics of using OPS for multi-block structured mesh application development. This is taken from a [presentation](https://op-dsl.github.io/docs/OPS/tutorial.pdf) given initially in April 2018 and subsequently updated for the latest release of OPS. 

## OPS Abstraction
OPS is a Domain Specific Language embedded in C/C++ and Fortran, targeting the development of multi-block structured mesh computations. The abstraction has two distinct components:  the definition of the mesh, and operations over the mesh.
* Defining a number of 1-3D blocks, and on them a number of datasets, which have specific extents in the different dimensions.
* Describing a parallel loop over a given block, with a given iteration range, executing a given "kernel function" at each mesh point, and describing what datasets are going to be accessed and how.
* Additionally, one needs to declare stencils (access patterns) that will be used in parallel loops to access datasets, and any global constants (read-only global scope variables)

Data and computations expressed this way can be automatically managed and parallelised by the OPS library. Higher dimensions are supported in the backend, but not currently by the code generators.

## Example Application
In this tutorial we will use an example application, a simple 2D iterative Laplace equation solver. 
* Go to the `OPS/apps/c/laplace2dtutorial/original` directory
* Open the `laplace2d.cpp` file
* It uses an $imax$ x $jmax$ mesh, with an additional 1 layers of boundary cells on all sides
* There are a number of loops that set the boundary conditions along the four edges
* The bulk of the simulation is spent in a whilel oop, repeating a stencil kernel with a maximum reduction, and a copy kernel
* Compile and run the code !

## Original - Initialisation
The original code begins with initializing the data arrays used in the calculation:
```
//Size along y
int jmax = 4094;
//Size along x
int imax = 4094;
//Size along x
int iter_max = 100;

double pi  = 2.0 * asin(1.0);
const double tol = 1.0e-6;
double error     = 1.0;

double *A;
double *Anew;
double *y0;

A    = (double *)malloc((imax+2) * (jmax+2) * sizeof(double));
Anew = (double *)malloc((imax+2) * (jmax+2) * sizeof(double));
y0   = (double *)malloc((imax+2) * sizeof(double));

memset(A, 0, (imax+2) * (jmax+2) * sizeof(double));
```
## Original - Boundary loops
The application sen sets boundary conditions:
```
for (int i = 0; i < imax+2; i++)
    A[(0)*(imax+2)+i]   = 0.0;

for (int i = 0; i < imax+2; i++)
    A[(jmax+1)*(imax+2)+i] = 0.0;

for (int j = 0; j < jmax+2; j++) {
    A[(j)*(imax+2)+0] = sin(pi * j / (jmax+1));
}

for (int j = 0; j < imax+2; j++) {
    A[(j)*(imax+2)+imax+1] = sin(pi * j / (jmax+1))*exp(-pi);
}
```  
Note how in the latter two loops the loop index is used.

## Original - Main iteration
The main iterative loop is a while loop iterating until the error tolarance is at a set level and the number of iterations are les than the maximum set. 
```
while ( error > tol && iter < iter_max ) {
  error = 0.0;
  for( int j = 1; j < jmax+1; j++ ) {
    for( int i = 1; i < imax+1; i++) {
      Anew[(j)*(imax+2)+i] = 0.25f * 
      ( A[(j)*(imax+2)+i+1] + A[(j)*(imax+2)+i-1]
      + A[(j-1)*(imax+2)+i] + A[(j+1)*(imax+2)+i]);
      error = fmax( error, fabs(Anew[(j)*(imax+2)+i]-A[(j)*(imax+2)+i]));
    }
  }
  for( int j = 1; j < jmax+1; j++ ) {
    for( int i = 1; i < imax+1; i++) {
      A[(j)*(imax+2)+i] = Anew[(j)*(imax+2)+i];    
    }
  }
  if(iter % 10 == 0) printf("%5d, %0.6f\n", iter, error);        
  iter++;
}
```
## Build OPS
Build OPS using instructions in the [Getting Started](https://ops-dsl.readthedocs.io/en/markdowndocdev/installation.html#getting-started) page. 

## Step 1 - Preparing to use OPS
Firstly, include the appropriate header files, then initialise OPS, and at the end finalise it.
* Define that this application is 2D, include the OPS header file, and create a header file where the outlined "elemental kernels" will live.
```
#define OPS_2D
#include <ops_seq.h>
#include "laplace_kernels.h" 
```
* Initialise and finalise OPS
```  
int main(int argc, const char** argv) {
  //Initialise the OPS library, passing runtime args, and setting diagnostics level to low (1)
  ops_init(argc, argv,1);
  ...
  ...
  //Finalising the OPS library
  ops_exit();
}  
```  
By this point you need OPS set up - take a look at the Makefile in step1, and observe that the include and library paths are added, and we link against `ops_seq`.

## Step 2 - OPS declarations
Now declare a block and data on the block :
```
//The 2D block
ops_block block = ops_decl_block(2, "my_grid");

//The two datasets
int size[] = {imax, jmax};
int base[] = {0,0};
int d_m[] = {-1,-1};
int d_p[] = {1,1};
ops_dat d_A    = ops_decl_dat(block, 1, size, base,
                               d_m, d_p, A,    "double", "A");
ops_dat d_Anew = ops_decl_dat(block, 1, size, base,
                               d_m, d_p, Anew, "double", "Anew");
```
Data sets have a size (number of mesh points in each dimension). There is passing for halos or boundaries in the positive (`d_p`) and negative directions (`d_m`). Here we use a 1 thick boundary layer. Base index can be defined as it may be different from 0 (e.g. in Fortran). Item these with a 0 base index and a 1 wide halo, these datasets can be indexed from −1 tosize +1.

OPS supports gradual conversion of applications to its API, but in this case the described data sizes will need to match:  the allocated memory and its extents need to be correctly described to OPS. In this example we have two `(imax+ 2) ∗ (jmax+ 2)` size arrays, and the total size in each dimension needs to matchsize `[i] + d_p[i] − d_m[i]`.  This is only supported for the sequential and OpenMP backends. If a `NULL` pointer is passed, OPS will allocate the data internally.

We also need to declare the stencils that will be used - in this example most loops use a simple 1-point stencil, and one uses a 5-point stencil:
```
//Two stencils, a 1-point, and a 5-point
int s2d_00[] = {0,0};
ops_stencil S2D_00 = ops_decl_stencil(2,1,s2d_00,"0,0");
int s2d_5pt[] = {0,0, 1,0, -1,0, 0,1, 0,-1};
ops_stencil S2D_5pt = ops_decl_stencil(2,5,s2d_5pt,"5pt");
```  
Different names may be used for stencils in your code, but we suggest using some convention.

## Step 3 - First parallel loop
You can now convert the first loop to use OPS:
```
for (int i = 0; i < imax+2; i++)
    A[(0)*(imax+2)+i]   = 0.0;
```    
This is a loop on the ottom boundary of the domain, which is at the −1 index for our dataset, therefore our iteration range will be over the entire domain, including halos in the X direction, and the bottom boundary in the Y direction.  The iteration range is given as beginning (inclusive) and end (exclusive) indices in the x, y, etc.  directions.
```
int bottom_range[] = {-1, imax+1, -1, 0};
```
Next, we need to outline the “elemental” into `laplacekernels.h`, and place the appropriate access objects - `ACC<double> &A`, in the kernel’s formal parameter list, and `(i,j)` are the stencil offsets in the X and Y directions respectively:
```
void set_zero(ACC<double> &A) {
  A(0,0) = 0.0;
}
```
The OPS parallel loop can now be written as follows:
```
ops_par_loop(set_zero, "set_zero", block, 2, bottom_range,
      ops_arg_dat(d_A, 1, S2D_00, "double", OPS_WRITE));
```
The loop will execute `set_zero` at each mesh point defined in the iteration range, and write the dataset `d_A` with the 1-point stencil. The `ops_par_loop` implies that the order in which mesh points will be executed will not affect the end result (within machine precision).
