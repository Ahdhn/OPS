# Introduction

OPS is a high-level framework with associated libraries and
preprocessors to generate parallel executables for applications on
**multi-block structured grids**. Multi-block structured grids consists
of an unstructured collection of structured meshes/grids. This document
describes the OPS C++ API, which supports the development of
single-block and multi-block structured meshes.
