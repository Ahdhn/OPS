# Introduction

## Overview

OPS is a high-level framework with associated libraries and preprocessors to generate parallel executables for applications on **multi-block structured grids**. Multi-block structured grids consists of an unstructured collection of structured meshes/grids. This document describes the OPS C++ API, which supports the development of single-block and multi-block structured meshes.
