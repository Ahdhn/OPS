# OPS

OPS (Oxford Parallel library for Structured mesh solvers) is a high-level embedded domain specific language for writing multi-block structured mesh algorithms, and the corresponding software library and code translation tools to enable automatic parallelisation of the high-level code on multi-core and many-core architectures.

This repository contains the implementation of the back-end library and the code-generator, and is structured as follows:

* `ops`: Implementation of the user and run-time OPS C/C++ APIs
* `apps`: Application examples in C.
  These are examples of user application code and also include the target parallel code generated by the OPS code generator.
* `ops_translator`: Python OPS code generator for C/C++ API
* `scripts` : example scripts for setting environmental variables and testing applications
* `cmake` : cmake installation files
* `makefiles` : makefile based installation files
* `doc`: Documentation
